# SPECIAL BASIC

This is a basic extension original written by Michael StoÌˆrch and Lars George for the Commodore C64.
This Basic extension provides 200 new basic functions.<br />
<br />
The source code is based on the existing disk images published by Markt & Technik

I have added some information and comments to the source, so that it is more easy to read and understand.<br />
The documantation is not perfect, and not really finished.
But i think, it is a good start, and if i can find the time, i will update the comments from time to time.<br />
